# Self Care Center  
______________________________________________________  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application is meant to bring calm and meditation in a crazy world. Americans are increasinly over-worked and unable to take the time to rest and center themselves. That's where "Self Care Center" comes in--the app provides calming mantras and affirmations to assist anyone who is looking to meditate but does not know where to start. "Self Care Center" can provide that starting place and give meditation newbies and pros alike a boost to this practice.

### Installation Instructions:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am currently a student in module one. It took me about 4 days (approximately 12 hours) to complete all features seen on this app.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
1. Implementing HTML, CSS and JavaScript through an entire appication build.
2. Use HTML & CSS to replicate a given "website".
3. Capture user events to effectively create a responsive webpage (via event listeners & handlers).
4. Build individual coding skills.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
1. A significant win was being able to organize the page using CSS with relatively few headaches. This was a goal of mine because I have previous eperience with CSS, but the page layout has always proved to be the most challenging.
2. A major challenge came up with handling user input to edit the messages as they choose. I first attempted to use an attribute `contentEditable` but this was challenging because I was unsure how to capture the new data. Once I opted to use the text input for editing messages, it was smooth sailing.
